--Let's say you work as a data analyst for your city, and your boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher. 
She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".

WITH safety_average_cte AS(
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) as 'rating' FROM citybikelanes
GROUP BY street)

SELECT street as "Safe Lane", rating FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >= 4.0;
